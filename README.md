# Lilo.Blog

**A blog for your journey of life and learning.**

With Lilo.Blog it's very easy to create your own blog. This is what you get:

- A blog that you own. Can be used as portfolio, as a project page or for documenting your journey.
- A simple admin interface to write blog posts.
- It's free! If you want your own custom domain (for example `yourname.com`) you can register it at any domain provider. You only pay a small fee for the domain while the blog stays free.
